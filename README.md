# Enter The Void

Deep technical learning ground backing the god-complex project. No surface-level tutorials. Every topic gets taken apart until the internals are understood.

## Structure

Each domain follows the same pattern:

```
topic/
  notes/        — distilled understanding in your own words
  exercises/    — hands-on code and challenges
  resources.md  — curated references worth revisiting
```

## Progression System

Every topic is tracked in `PROGRESS.md` with four levels:

| Level | Tag | Meaning | Proof Required |
|-------|-----|---------|----------------|
| **Void** | `[ ]` | Haven't touched it | — |
| **Exploring** | `[~]` | Reading, running examples | Notes exist |
| **Solid** | `[▪]` | Can explain and build without references | Exercises completed |
| **Mastered** | `[█]` | Can teach it, know the internals | Project or teach-back writeup |

The tags aren't self-reported feelings. They're backed by artifacts in the repo.

## Domains

1. **Systems** — OS, memory, processes, kernel-level understanding
2. **Languages** — Language internals, runtimes, compilers
3. **Data Structures** — Implementations from scratch, not textbook definitions
4. **Algorithms** — Pattern recognition, complexity, real implementations
5. **Networking** — TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, sockets, protocols
6. **Databases** — Query engines, indexing, storage engines, replication
7. **Architecture** — System design, distributed systems, scaling
8. **Security** — Crypto, auth, vulnerability understanding
9. **Web Internals** — Browser engine, rendering pipeline, V8, event loop
10. **Projects** — Build-to-learn implementations that tie concepts together
