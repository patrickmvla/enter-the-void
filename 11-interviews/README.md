# 11 — Interview Prep

Everything in `01`–`10` builds the foundation. This is where it gets pressure-tested.

## Structure

```
11-interviews/
├── coding/          # leetcode-style problems, patterns, timed practice
├── system-design/   # design rounds: end-to-end system breakdowns
├── behavioral/      # STAR stories, leadership principles, conflict resolution
└── mock-runs/       # full mock interview logs and retros
```

## Coding

Pattern-based approach. Don't grind randomly — group by technique:
- Arrays & hashing
- Two pointers / sliding window
- Stack / queue
- Binary search
- Trees & graphs (BFS/DFS)
- Dynamic programming
- Backtracking
- Intervals / greedy

Each problem: solution, time/space complexity, edge cases, what tripped you up.

## System Design

Framework for every question:
1. **Clarify** — requirements, constraints, scale
2. **Estimate** — traffic, storage, bandwidth
3. **High-level design** — components, data flow
4. **Deep dive** — database schema, API design, scaling bottlenecks
5. **Trade-offs** — justify every decision

## Behavioral

Build a bank of stories that cover:
- Technical leadership
- Conflict / disagreement
- Failure / learning
- Ambiguity / ownership
- Impact / results

## Mock Runs

Simulate real conditions:
- 45-min coding (2 problems)
- 45-min system design (1 problem)
- 30-min behavioral (3-4 questions)
- Log what went well, what didn't, action items
